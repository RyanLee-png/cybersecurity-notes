# Cybersecurity Notes

This repository documents my self-study journey in cybersecurity.
Rather than focusing on advanced hacking techniques, I focus on
understanding systems, security principles, and my own learning process.

I am a Vietnamese high school student (Class of 2027) aiming to pursue
a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity in Europe.

## How I Learn
- Focus on understanding *why* systems work, not just *how*
- Write reflections after each topic to identify gaps in knowledge
- Build small labs to test concepts
- Review mistakes and misconceptions regularly

## Repository Structure
- `networking/` – Networking fundamentals and protocols
- `linux/` – Linux basics, permissions, and system concepts
- `labs/` – Small practical labs to apply theoretical knowledge
- `reflections/` – Personal reflections on challenges and learning strategies

## Current Focus
- Networking models (OSI, TCP/IP)
- Linux permissions and security basics
- Password security and common weaknesses
