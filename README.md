# Cybersecurity Notes
-This repository is not intended to demonstrate advanced hacking skills
-Instead, it documents my learning process, technical thinking, and foundations
-in cybersecurity, which I believe are essential for long-term growth in the field
-This repository documents my self-study journey in cybersecurity as a Vietnamese high school student aiming to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity in Europe.

## Topics Covered
- Networking fundamentals
- Linux basics
- Cybersecurity concepts
- Ethical hacking fundamentals
- Web security basics

## Purpose
- Build strong foundations in cybersecurity
- Demonstrate self-study discipline and consistency
- Support my university application portfolio

## Learning philosophy
I focus on building strong fundamentals and documenting my thinking process.  
This repository reflects my consistency, self-discipline, and long-term goal of studying cybersecurity in Europe

## Personal Motivation

I started learning cybersecurity not only because of its technical challenges, but also because it combines logic, problem-solving, and real-world impact.

As a Vietnamese high school student aiming to study cybersecurity in Europe, this repository represents my commitment to long-term self-study, discipline, and independent thinking. Each note and lab reflects how my understanding has evolved over time.

## Why Cybersecurity at TalTech

I am particularly interested in studying cybersecurity at TalTech because of its
strong focus on technical fundamentals, practical learning, and its reputation in
applied engineering education.

I value the emphasis on understanding systems deeply rather than using tools
superficially, which aligns with my learning approach.

## Future Direction
In the next stage, I plan to deepen my knowledge in web security, cryptography fundamentals, and incident response, and to apply these concepts through small practical labs.
