# Week 1 Reflection

This week I studied the OSI model and basic networking concepts.
At first, I memorized the layers without understanding their purpose.

After rewriting the model in my own words, I realized how each layer relates to security.
This helped me understand why attackers target different layers.

Next week, I will focus on applying this knowledge to real scenarios.
