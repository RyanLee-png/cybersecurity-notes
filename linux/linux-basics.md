# Linux Basics

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in servers, cybersecurity, and ethical hacking environments.

## Key concepts
- Terminal and command-line interface
- File system structure
- Permissions (read, write, execute)

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
Most servers and security tools run on Linux.  
Understanding Linux is essential for penetration testing, system hardening, and incident response.

## Personal notes
At first, using the terminal felt uncomfortable compared to a graphical interface.  
However, I learned that mastering basic Linux commands gives much more control and flexibility.  
This motivated me to practice Linux daily as a cybersecurity stude

## Personal Reflection

At first, using the Linux terminal felt uncomfortable compared to graphical interfaces. I often hesitated because a single wrong command could affect the system.

Over time, I realized that the terminal provides transparency and control, which are essential in cybersecurity. Understanding Linux helped me see how permissions, processes, and system behavior directly impact security.

This experience motivated me to practice Linux daily, as I see it as a core skill for penetration testing and system hardening.
