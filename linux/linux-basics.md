# Linux Basics

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in servers, cybersecurity, and ethical hacking environments.

## Key concepts
- Terminal and command-line interface
- File system structure

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
Most servers and security tools run on Linux.  
Understanding Linux is essential for penetration testing, system hardening, and incident response.

## Personal notes
At first, using the terminal felt uncomfortable compared to a graphical interface.  
However, I learned that mastering basic Linux commands gives much more control and flexibility.  
This motivated me to practice Linux daily as a cybersecurity stude
