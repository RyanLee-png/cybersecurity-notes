# Lab 01 – Understanding Port Scanning

## Goal
Understand what port scanning is and why attackers use it.

## Theory
Port scanning is a technique used to discover open ports and running services on a system.

## Security relevance
- Used in the reconnaissance phase of attacks
- Helps identify vulnerable services
- Commonly performed using tools like Nmap

## My reflection
This lab helped me realize that even simple information gathering can expose serious security risks.  
It changed how I think about system exposure on the internet.
