# Lab 01 – Understanding Port Scanning

## Goal
Understand what port scanning is and why attackers use it.

## Theory
Port scanning is a technique used to discover open ports and running services on a system.

## Security relevance
- Used in the reconnaissance phase of attacks
- Helps identify vulnerable services
- Commonly performed using tools like Nmap

## Personal Reflection

This lab helped me realize that attackers do not need complex exploits to identify potential weaknesses. Simple information gathering, such as port scanning, already reveals valuable insights about a system.

It changed my perspective on system exposure and made me more cautious about how services are configured and exposed to the internet.
