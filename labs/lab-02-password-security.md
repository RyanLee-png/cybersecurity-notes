# Lab 02 – Password Security Basics

## Goal
Understand why weak passwords are dangerous and how attackers exploit them.

## Theory
Passwords are often the weakest link in system security. Attacks like brute force and credential stuffing rely on poor password practices.

## Security relevance
- Weak passwords enable unauthorized access
- Reused passwords increase attack surface

## Personal Reflection
This lab helped me realize that security failures often come from human behavior rather than complex vulnerabilities.
