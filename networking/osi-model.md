# OSI Model

## What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how data flows through a network.

## 7 Layers of the OSI Model
1. Physical – cables, signals, hardware
2. Data Link – MAC address, switches
3. Network – IP addressing, routing
4. Transport – TCP / UDP
5. Session – session control
6. Presentation – encryption, formatting
7. Application – HTTP, FTP, DNS

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
Understanding the OSI model helps identify where attacks occur, such as:
- Network layer: IP spoofing
- Transport layer: SYN flood
- Application layer: SQL Injection

## Personal Notes
This is one of the most important foundations in cybersecurity.
