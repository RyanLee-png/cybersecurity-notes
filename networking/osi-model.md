# OSI Model

## What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that explains how data travels from one device to another over a network.  
It divides network communication into 7 layers, each with a specific role.

## 7 Layers of the OSI Model
1. Physical – cables, signals, hardware
2. Data Link – MAC addresses, switches
3. Network – IP addressing, routing
4. Transport – TCP/UDP, ports
5. Session – session control
6. Presentation – encryption, data formatting
7. Application – HTTP, FTP, DNS

## Why it matters in cybersecurity
Understanding the OSI model helps identify where attacks occur:
- Network layer: IP spoofing
- Transport layer: SYN flood attacks
- Application layer: SQL injection, XSS
- 
## Personal notes
Before learning the OSI model, networking felt confusing to me.  
After studying it, I realized that most cyber attacks target specific layers, not the entire system.  
This model helps me think like both a defender and an attacker.
